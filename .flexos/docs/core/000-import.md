# IRINA Project Overview

Welcome to the IRINA project documentation. IRINA is envisioned as a personal hub for independent creators to share their creativity and accept support, streamlining the process of receiving payments and donations without complex e-commerce setups or high platform fees. This document serves as a high-level overview and import point for all detailed specifications within the project.

**Core Concept:** IRINA addresses the problem faced by independent creators who struggle to find a simple, branded platform to accept payments for services (like lessons) and donations from fans. Our solution provides a highly customizable platform for generating shareable payment links, managing earnings, and showcasing a unique brand through a personalized public profile.

**Target Users:** Independent creators, teachers, musicians, artists, and freelancers seeking a direct, branded way to accept ad-hoc payments and donations.

**Unique Value Proposition:** Unlike generic payment solutions, IRINA offers a personalized, branded public profile page and simple, shareable payment items specifically tailored for individual creators, emphasizing direct interaction and minimal setup.

This project is built around key features such as creating and managing payment items, secure authentication, personalized public profiles, integrated payment processing via Stripe, and comprehensive payment tracking. The following specification files delve into the details of these features, pages, user flows, and data models, providing a complete blueprint for the IRINA platform.
