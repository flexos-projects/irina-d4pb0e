# Page: Dashboard

The Dashboard serves as the primary authenticated landing page and central control panel for creators after they log into IRINA. Its purpose is to provide an immediate overview of their activity, key statistics, and quick access to essential management features, ensuring an efficient and intuitive user experience.

Upon logging in, Irina will be greeted with a personalized welcome message. The page will prominently display quick statistics such as total payments received or recent earnings, offering an immediate snapshot of her financial activity. A dedicated section will list her active payment items, providing quick options to edit, share, or toggle their visibility. This allows for rapid adjustments and promotion of her offerings.

Below the item overview, a summary of recent transactions will be displayed, enabling Irina to quickly track incoming payments and donations without navigating to a separate page. The dashboard will also feature a clear and accessible navigation sidebar, linking to dedicated pages for 'My Items' (for full management), 'Payments' (for detailed transaction history), and 'Settings' (for account and profile configurations). This design ensures that all critical functionalities are only a click away, making the dashboard the true hub for managing her creative business on IRINA.
