# Feature: Create & Manage Payment/Donation Items

This specification details the core feature enabling creators like Irina to define, customize, and manage the payment and donation items they offer to their audience. This functionality is central to IRINA's value proposition, allowing for direct monetization of services and creative work without the overhead of a full e-commerce store.

Creators will be able to create various types of items, such as a "1-hour English lesson," a "Music Donation," or a specific "Art Commission." Each item will require a clear title, an optional rich-text description to provide context or details, a fixed monetary amount, and the currency. To enhance personal branding and appeal, creators can also upload a custom image for each item.

Upon creation, the system will generate a unique, shareable URL for each payment item. This link can be distributed directly to students, fans, or shared across social media platforms, making it incredibly easy for the audience to access and support the creator's work. Items can be toggled between active and inactive states, allowing creators to control their availability without deleting them. The ability to edit existing items ensures flexibility, while deletion provides full control over their offerings. This feature directly addresses the user stories of creating specific payment links, adding custom branding, and easily sharing these offerings, forming the backbone of a creator's presence on IRINA.
