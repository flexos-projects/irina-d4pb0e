# Flow: Irina's Onboarding & First Payment Item Creation

This flow outlines the critical journey for a new creator, from their initial interaction with IRINA to successfully publishing their first payment or donation item. The goal is to provide a seamless, guided experience that quickly enables creators to start monetizing their work.

1.  **Visit Landing Page**: Irina discovers IRINA, lands on the public homepage, and is prompted to sign up, clicking the 'Sign Up' call to action.
2.  **Create Account**: She proceeds to the signup page, providing her email and a secure password to register her new IRINA account.
3.  **Welcome & Initial Profile Setup**: Upon successful registration, the system displays a personalized welcome message. Irina is then guided to set her public display name and optionally upload a profile picture, establishing her initial public persona.
4.  **Connect Stripe Account**: The system prompts Irina to connect her Stripe account, which is essential for receiving payments. A prominent 'Skip for now' option is provided, allowing her to defer this step if she prefers.
5.  **Create First Payment Item**: Regardless of Stripe connection status, Irina is immediately directed to the 'Create New Item' page. The interface might suggest a common item type, such as '1-hour English Lesson' or 'Music Donation', to ease the creation process.
6.  **Configure Item Details**: Irina fills in the necessary details for her first item: a title, a detailed description, the specific amount, currency, and an optional image to represent her offering.
7.  **Publish Item**: Once satisfied, Irina clicks 'Save & Publish'. The system processes the item, makes it live, and generates its unique, shareable URL.
8.  **View Dashboard**: Finally, Irina is redirected to her personalized dashboard, where her newly created item is prominently displayed, along with options to share it and explore other platform features. This completes the core onboarding, making Irina ready to accept support.
